				<h1>Why Launch Academy?</h1>
				<p>After discovering that I wanted a new challenge I decided to leave my last career as a District Manager. It took me a lot of time and thought to come to this conclusion, but ultimately I wanted to find a new career that utilized more of my strengths while also contributing value to others and society.  I love creating things, solving problems, and organizing. I loved web design in high school but after graduating had not pursued it until I met a new friend, Hugo. He is a web designer and re-ignited my passion for the web. Recently I had an incredible opportunity to partner with Hugo and he has been an invaluable teacher.  In return for his mentorship, I have helped systemize his business and solidify his sales process. I believe Launch Academy would provide an incredible environment to learn and meet really interesting people to expedite my learning curve. I am an extremely dedicated student and love to teach what I learn to others.  If selected to be apart of Launch Academy I believe my leadership and work ethic will help to inspire and motivate the other students around me.   </p>

				<h3>Reasons I Want To Be A Web Developer:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><p>Acquire the tools to be able to work anywhere in the world.  It would give me the ability to do some traveling or move back home to be closer to my family.</p></li>
					<li><p>Working with the Internet gives me the ability to influence more people.  As a District Manager I was only able to influence 100-300 people a year.  As a web designer it gives me the capabilities to create something that will affect thousands and even millions.</p></li>
					<li><p>I love how fast the web grows and evolves.  I am a firm believer in Kaizen, a Japanese saying meaning continuous growth.  Since the web is constantly evolving I will be challenged to do more, learn more, and innovate more.</p></li>
					<li><p>I am an entrepreneur at heart. I starting my first company <a href="http://www.greatlakesaquaponics.com" target="_blank">Great Lakes Aquaponics</a> when I was 16.  I have a couple of ideas that I would really like to see be created for my business and I know that with a little more programming knowledge I can make this a reality.</p></li>
					<li><p>Finally, to learn marketable skills that will allow me to get a good paying job while I work on personal side projects. </p></li>
				</ol>
