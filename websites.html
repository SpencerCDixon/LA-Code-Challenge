				<h1>Favorite Websites</h1>
					<p>Choosing my favorite websites is a daunting task.  There are so many different ones that I like for different reasons.  Whether it be for entertainment, information, aesthetics, or just to be social.  I have done my best to narrow it down to my top 10.  Believe me, it wasn't easy.</p>

				<h2 class="subheader"> Spencer's Top 10 Favorite Websites  </h2>
				<p style="font-size: .9em; font-style: italic;">(These websites are in no particular order)</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.css-tricks.com" target="_blank"><h3>CSS-Tricks</h3></a>
								<p>
									What I like about CSS-Tricks is how it is a resource for free learning material.  I also really like Chris's personality and how he presents his information.
								</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank"><h3>Treehouse</h3></a>
								<p>
									After trying a few different online code schools (Codeschool &amp; Codeacademy) this has been my favorite.  The teachers are knowledgeable, the video production is great, and the UX is fantastic. (I also won free CampSass tickets from them which is pretty rad! Gotta love their contests and giveaways) <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/spencercdixon" target="_blank">Here is my profile at Treehouse.</a>
								</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/browse" target="_blank"><h3>Ted Talks</h3></a>
								<p>
									I love Ted Talks when I have free time and don't know what to do.  Often learn some pretty interesting things.  A while back I had a 30-day challenge with a friend where we watched at least one Ted Talk a day! 
								</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank"><h3>Youtube</h3></a>
								<p>
									Three words: funny vine videos. 
								</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.hulu.com" target="_blank"><h3>Hulu</h3></a>
								<p>
									I don't have a TV or cable so when I do want to watch some TV I use Hulu.  Right now my favorite tv shows are: Vikings, Modern Family, and Hannibal.
								</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.themeforest.net" target="_blank"><h3>Theme Forest</h3></a>
								<p>
									Theme forest is easy to get lost in.  Looking at themes is one of the most addictive things in the world.  Making a decision on which to use is the hardest part! 
								</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.colorschemedesigner.com" target="_blank"><h3>Color Scheme Designer</h3></a>
								<p>
									This one is great for putting together quick colorschemes while building a website.  Saves me a lot of time and makes my quick mockups look a lot nicer.
								</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank"><h3>Facebook</h3></a>
								<p>
									Since living out in CA for the last 5 years has put me far away from my family and friends Facebook has been my favorite tool to stay in touch.  All my friends from high school and I have a private group where we post whats going on in our lives and stay up to date.  I did install a program that limits my facebook time during 8am-8pm and then unlimited after 8pm.  Definitely helped my productivity!
								</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="https://github.com" target="_blank"><h3>Github</h3></a>
								<p>
									To be perfectly honest I havn't used Github much since I just started learning Ruby on Rails.  However, I can already foresee after completing Launch Academy this will be one of my top favorite websites of all time. 
								</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank"><h3>Skype</h3></a>
								<p>
									I recently just moved to LA from Santa Barbara so skype is great for connecting with my girlfriend.  Not to mention it's allowing me to have this interview with Launch Academy! Therefore, it had to make it on the list.
